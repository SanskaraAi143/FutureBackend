# This file makes the 'tests' directory a Python package.
# It helps with test discovery and allows for package-relative imports if needed within tests,
# though typically tests import the modules they are testing using absolute paths
# from the project's source directory (e.g., from multi_agent_orchestrator.agent import OrchestratorAgent).
